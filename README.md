# GenericTypeAdditions

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that adds more types to the GenericTypes lists

There is no configuration currently, meaning to add more types you must recompile the mod

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [GenericTypeAdditions.dll](https://github.com/badhaloninja/GenericTypeAdditions/releases/latest/download/GenericTypeAdditions.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
